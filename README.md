# 3D-Footplate
The 3D footplate is a non-commercially viable tool to assist medical imaging of complex hindfoot pathologies. This 'Class I Medical Device' helps to position and fixate the foot to the lower leg, allowing clinical stress tests to be simulated during CT scans. The medicla image acquired can provide quantitative displacements of bones.
